This approach can be applied in virtually any context as positive case counts are available in every country.\n",

This gives a proportion indicating the average level of simple growth over the forecast period. Values over the red line indicating 0.01 tend to be upward while those under 0.01 tend to be flat.

While I_0 can be kept small and R_0 left at zero, a large value of S_0 has proved to be a challenge to estimating the model parameters.

    "\"In any epidemic, $R_t$ is the measure known as the effective reproduction number. It's the number of people who become infected per infectious person at time $t$. The most well-known version of this number is the basic reproduction number: $R_0$ when $t=0$. However, $R_0$ is a single measure that does not adapt with changes in behavior and restrictions.\" - Kevin Systrom\n",

    "The approach starts with the intuition form Bettencourt and Ribeiro (2008), that the number of observed cases $k$ is driven by the basic reproductive number $R_0$ which itself is unobserved and unknown. Through the use of Bayes Theorem one can invert this relationship and show how likely a given effective reproductive number ($R_t$) is given the observed number of cases. By connecting these relationships over time more evidence can be given for a more specific relationship between the effective reproductive number and the observed number of cases $k$.\n",

For one thing, there is so much heterogeneity in the per capita testing capacity of countries around the world that it would be foolhardy to try to draw any broad conclusion about the virus’s transmissibility from all that disparate data. For another, the figures for reported cases lag actual infections by at least 10 to 14 days.\" - Dr. Gabriel Leung\n",
