------------------------------------- FORECASTING FRAMEWORK ---------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The goal of this framework is to set forth a methodoly for you, the user, to work within.

Suppose that you have a metric x. Suppose further that x changes with time.
We shall donate the value of x, at time t, as x(t).

If we were to know future values of x, then we could prepare for that event!
For example if we knew that corona was coming we could have prepared!

We say that x(t) is a time-series, because it is a function of time.

All submissions/ideas/contributions should ideally be models that can predict future values of x
i.e. x1,x2,x3,x4,....

We measure *accuracy of forecasts* by measuring how far off it was from actual values.
